from django.db import models

# Create your models here.
'''
In the example above, ***** Comment will be the target of any on_delete handler when you delete Post, 
but not the other way around.****** If you delete a Comment instance, nothing will happen to  Post.
class Post(models.Model):
	title = models.CharField(max_length=255)

class Comment(models.Model):
	content = models.TextField()  #üëáüèª
	post = models.ForeignKey(Post, on_delete=[?])



models.CASCADE

Let‚Äôs take our Post and Comment example and set on_delete to models.CASCADE

class Comment(models.Model):
	...  #                                          üëáüèª
	post = models.ForeignKey(Post, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

When we call post.delete(), it will cascade down to the foreign key relationship(s). Meaning that both Post and Comment get deleted.

Each Model here is related to a table in the database. 
As we don‚Äôt have these tables in the database yet, 
let‚Äôs create a rule to make them (in Django these rules are called migrations):
